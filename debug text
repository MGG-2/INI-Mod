1. Tabview for Better User Interface
File: ctk_tabview.py
Description: This file contains the implementation of the CTkTabView class, which can be used to create a tabbed interface in your application.


2. Textbox Needs Rework
File: ctk_textbox.py
Description: The CTkTextbox class is defined in this file. You can study its implementation and adapt or extend it to fit the specific needs of your project.


3. Switches Needs to Either be Removed or Reworked
Suggestion: Consider evaluating the current implementation of switches in your project and decide whether they can be improved or should be replaced with another UI element.


4. Tabview Should Make it Easier to Navigate the Options from the Imported .ini File
Action Step: Utilize the CTkTabView class to organize the options from the .ini file into separate tabs, making them easier to navigate and modify.


5. Presets for Faster Changes
Suggestion: Implement a feature that allows users to save and load presets for .ini file configurations. This can be achieved by creating a UI element that lets users select from a list of predefined or user-saved presets.


6. Rework How to Change the .ini File
Suggestion: Consider improving the user interface and experience for modifying .ini files. This could involve implementing a more intuitive UI layout, adding validation for input values, or providing feedback on successful changes.
Relevant Files for Further Exploration:
ctk_entry.py: Contains the CTkEntry class for creating entry widgets.
